House Price Prediction
🏠 Overview — House Price Prediction Project

The House Price Prediction project is a Machine Learning-based regression system designed to estimate the selling price of houses using various real-estate features.
By analyzing attributes like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, total living area, condition, and proximity to amenities, the model learns complex patterns in the housing data to predict realistic property values.

This project demonstrates the end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including:

Data collection & preprocessing

Feature selection and engineering

Model training using RandomForestRegressor

Model evaluation and optimization

Deployment via a Streamlit web application


The dataset (House Price India.csv) contains 14,619 records and 23 attributes, offering insights into how different property characteristics impact house prices.
